In my paper, I will be discussing tools of reproducible work flow.
Including the tools I specifically used, what they are and what they
do.\
I will also be going over my experience using these systems, touching on
the things that I found easy and things I found rather difficult.

Makefile is a tool that complies different documents and files together
to make one central document.\
\#what role it plays in reproducible workflow\
This is useful in the role of reprpoducible workflow, because for
everyone who has the correct documents, images and graphs, the Makefile
just contains a list of instructions on how to compile the sources in a
specific order.

![Git-Bash logo](../images/git-logo.png) Git is a version control system
that captures specific versions of multiple documents.\
We use git to upload and update versions of our work, folders and
documents to a master repository on github.

![Github logo](../images/github-logo.png) Github is the master
repository on the internet, which multiple people in a group can extact
your work.\
This allows for good collaboration for everyone to be working on the
same document on multiple local repositories and upload changes that
everyone can see.\
Git and github also keep track of all versions that have been passed.

![Pandoc logo](../images/pandoc-logo.png) Pandoc is a file converter. It
converts files of a certain type to another type, including extensions
such as, .txt, .pdf, .html, .tex, etc.\
Pandoc is very easy to use, though the command shell, to convert
documents with ease. Converting code and txt documents to nice pds or
html documents that look more presentable.

![Markdown logo](../images/markdown-logo.png) Markdown converts regular
documents into other formats such as html.\
I originally used notepad++ to create my .txt documents. Since I don't
have a .md extension automatically, I just convert the .txt document to
.md document using git-bash or windows powershell.

Creating the documents, sections of the paper, folders through git were
the easiest parts of this whole project.

Learning how to use Makefile, what exactly it does and how it works was
definitely the hardest part of this assignment, as well as coming up
with the code for Makefile.\
I realized that Makefile is just a txt document but without the .txt
extension in the name.\
It takes all of the files that you are working on and compiles it into a
report for you.

Mostly realizing that Makefile was a .txt document without the .txt
extension. Once I realized that, it clarified things a lot,
conceptually.\
Also creating the code for the Makefile document made me uneasy until I
knew the theory of what I was doing.

Making the makefile and writing the report of all the txt documents was
the most time consuming parts of this project.

I got help from my GSI in discussion and in office hours on the
logistics of Makefile.

Making directories = 5 min

Making .gitignore = .5 min

Writing the content of the paper = 2 hrs

Saving the images = 5 min

Adding/Committing/Pushing to git = 5 min

Writing the Makefile = 1.5 hrs

Total time = 3 hrs, 45.5 min

All in all, the project was fun to learn Makefile--a specific compiling
tool used for quick compiling.\
The only way to learn is to do things myself. So I found this project
rather fun and imformative.
