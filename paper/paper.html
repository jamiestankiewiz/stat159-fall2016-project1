<p>In my paper, I will be discussing tools of reproducible work flow. Including the tools I specifically used, what they are and what they do. I will also be going over my experience using these systems, touching on the things that I found easy and things I found rather difficult.</p>
<p>Makefile is a tool that complies different documents and files together to make one central document.<br />
This is useful in the role of reproducible workflow, because for everyone who has the correct documents, images and graphs, the Makefile just contains a list of instructions on how to compile the sources in a specific order.</p>
<p><img src="../images/git-logo.png" alt="Git-Bash logo" /> Git is a version control system that captures specific versions of multiple documents.<br />
We use git to upload and update versions of our work, folders and documents to a master repository on github.</p>
<p><img src="../images/github-logo.png" alt="Github logo" /> Github is the master repository on the internet, which multiple people in a group can extact your work.<br />
This allows for good collaboration for everyone to be working on the same document on multiple local repositories and upload changes that everyone can see.<br />
Git and github also keep track of all versions that have been passed.</p>
<p><img src="../images/pandoc-logo.png" alt="Pandoc logo" /> Pandoc is a file converter. It converts files of a certain type to another type, including extensions such as, .txt, .pdf, .html, .tex, etc.<br />
Pandoc is very easy to use, though the command shell, to convert documents with ease. Converting code and txt documents to nice pds or html documents that look more presentable.</p>
<p><img src="../images/markdown-logo.png" alt="Markdown logo" /> Markdown converts regular documents into other formats such as html.<br />
I originally used notepad++ to create my .txt documents. Since I don't have a .md extension automatically, I just convert the .txt document to .md document using git-bash or windows powershell.</p>
<p>Creating the documents, sections of the paper, folders through git were the easiest parts of this whole project.</p>
<p>Learning how to use Makefile, what exactly it does and how it works was definitely the hardest part of this assignment, as well as coming up with the code for Makefile. I realized that Makefile is just a txt document but without the .txt extension in the name. It takes all of the files that you are working on and compiles it into a report for you.</p>
<p>Mostly realizing that Makefile was a .txt document without the .txt extension. Once I realized that, it clarified things a lot, conceptually. Also creating the code for the Makefile document made me uneasy until I knew the theory of what I was doing.</p>
<p>Making the makefile and writing the report of all the txt documents was the most time consuming parts of this project.</p>
<p>I got help from my GSI in discussion and in office hours on the logistics of Makefile.</p>
<p>Making directories = 5 min</p>
<p>Making .gitignore = .5 min</p>
<p>Writing the content of the paper = 2 hrs</p>
<p>Saving the images = 5 min</p>
<p>Adding/Committing/Pushing to git = 5 min</p>
<p>Writing the Makefile = 1.5 hrs</p>
<p>Total time = 3 hrs, 45.5 min</p>
<p>All in all, the project was fun to learn Makefile--a specific compiling tool used for quick compiling.<br />
The only way to learn is to do things myself. So I found this project rather fun and imformative.</p>
