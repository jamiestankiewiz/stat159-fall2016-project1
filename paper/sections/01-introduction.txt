#explain what makefile is
Makefile is a tool that complies different documents and files together to make one central document.  
#what role it plays in reproducible workflow  
This is useful in the role of reprpoducible workflow, because for everyone who has the correct documents, images and graphs, the Makefile just contains a list of instructions on how to compile the sources in a specific order.  


#What is Git
Git is a version control system that captures specific versions of multiple documents.  
We use git to upload and update versions of our work, folders and documents to a master repository on github.  
#what is github/role in this project  
Github is the master repository on the internet, which multiple people in a group can extact your work.  
This allows for good collaboration for everyone to be working on the same document on multiple local repositories and upload changes that everyone can see.  
Git and github also keep track of all versions that have been passed.  


#what is pandoc
Pandoc is a file converter.  It converts files of a certain type to another type, including extensions such as, .txt, .pdf, .html, .tex, etc.  
Pandoc is very easy to use, though the command shell, to convert documents with ease.  Converting code and txt documents to nice pds or html documents that look more presentable.  


#what is markdown/sources to get the job done
Markdown converts regular documents into other formats such as html.  
I originally used notepad++ to create my .txt documents. Since I don't have a .md extension automatically, I just convert the .txt document to .md document using git-bash or windows powershell.
