Creating the documents, sections of the paper, folders through git were the easiest parts of this whole project.  

Learning how to use Makefile, what exactly it does and how it works was definitely the hardest part of this assignment, as well as coming up with the code for Makefile.  I realized that Makefile is just a txt document but without the .txt extension in the name.  It takes all of the files that you are working on and compiles it into a report for you.  


Mostly realizing that Makefile was a .txt document without the .txt extension.  Once I realized that, it clarified things a lot, conceptually.  Also creating the code for the Makefile document made me uneasy until I knew the theory of what I was doing.  


Making the makefile and writing the report of all the txt documents was the most time consuming parts of this project.  


I got help from my GSI in discussion and in office hours on the logistics of Makefile.  



Making directories = 5 min

Making .gitignore = .5 min

Writing the content of the paper = 2 hrs

Saving the images = 5 min

Adding/Committing/Pushing to git = 5 min

Writing the Makefile = 1.5 hrs

Total time = 3 hrs, 45.5 min
